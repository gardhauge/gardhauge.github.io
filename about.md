My name is Gard. I’m a dedicated husband and father, concerned environmentalist, hobby philosopher and a software development professional.

I strongly believe humanity is entering a new era. We need all voices possible in all possible medias to make sure the new era is going to be a better and much, much greener one than the current. Getting the new era right is possible, it’s within our reach. I hope to shed some light on some of the actions I believe is needed. The most important change of our time will be the change of [how we create money](http://positivemoney.org/). 

As for software development, I have fallen in love with the Ruby ecosystem, however lately I've been getting more and more interested in JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS. I aim to bring software to the world that will facilitate an easier transition to a better and much greener era for humanity. I believe the role of technology, and thus software, is to make life better. If it doesn’t then the technology should be turned off and recycled. There’s a lot of wrong use of technology these days. A lot of technology is used to make the world worse, or it’s indirect consequences are much worse than the positive effects it has for the user. I hope to bring better uses for technology into the world.
