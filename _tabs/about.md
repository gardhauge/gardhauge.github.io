I'm Gard. I'm a software developer of profession. I'm constantly learning new things in all aspects of life, and this blog is where I share the learning.

I believe that for most, being a good developer is a surplus activity. Meaning you have to optimize the rest of your life to be the best developer you can be. For me to be a really good developer, I have to keep my body strong, my mind healthy, my diet nutritional, my family taken care of, my finances under control... All aspects of life affect my ability to perform high quality software development. I think it's the same for most developers, but I also think that not too many developers are concious of this. 

My goal is to be a truly stellar developer, and with this blog I will try to share how that is going. I can't just write about coding, I need to write about all the aspects of living optimally.
