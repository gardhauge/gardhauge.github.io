title: "New theme, new beginnings"
---

It's been almost ten years since I did anything with this blog. The last thing I did was to update the theme and forget about the whole blog. Well, times are changing, I've made a lot of progress both as a developer and as a person. It's time to start blogging again, and what better way to do that than start with a new theme? I fell in love with the chirpy theme. Check it out here: https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy 

One of the reasons I never got around to blogging that much, was I could never decide what to write about, what to focus on. I was thinking that my github pages blog should be coding centric, but for a long time I wanted to blog about anything but software development. This time around I'll take the liberty to write about whatever, but I'll find a way to organize the site in a useful way with tags or whatever.
